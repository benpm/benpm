Hey there! Sometimes I make things, in the veins of [game development](https://github.com/benpm/rundash), [machine learning](https://github.com/haydn-jones/PettingZoo), [web development](https://github.com/benpm/js-value-noise), [graphics](https://github.com/benpm/cuda-raytracer), etc. You can check out my [website](https://benpm.github.io/) for a big collection of projects I've worked on.
